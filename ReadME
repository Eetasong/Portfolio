This website uses Bootstrap, Sass, and Parcel.
Run npm install after cloning.
The run "npm run dev"

The localhost does not run the dist file because i have changed the root dir for parcel into docs.
So, to run the website, navigate to docs folder and open index.html.
Then start live server on the "docs/index.html"

I will publish this publicly after i give it a finishing touch.
